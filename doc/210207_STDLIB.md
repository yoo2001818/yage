# Standard Library
While yage should be designed to support arbitrary data, it should support
numbers of standard components and systems, which comes with all implementations
of yage.

- transform
- name
- parent
- geometry
- light
- shader
- material
- texture
- mesh
- camera

Furthermore, we need a better way to define 'one-off' entities for textures
and geometries. They are currently defined by creating an entity, but that's
pretty cumbersome.

## Limited set of lights / materials
For now, yage supports programmable (arbitrary) lights and materials.
However, this is getting it nowhere because I don't have any idea how to
implement "standard" materials over it. Because of this situation, it'd be
better to start with "classic" materials and lights, and slowly make it
programmable.

To do that, we can think of a concept called "contract" - A component implies
another component, etc.
