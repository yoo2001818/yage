# Standard Library
While yage should be designed to support arbitrary data, it should support
numbers of standard components and systems, which comes with all implementations
of yage.

- transform
- name
- parent
- geometry
- light
- shader
- material
- texture
- mesh
- camera

Furthermore, we need a better way to define 'one-off' entities for textures
and geometries. They are currently defined by creating an entity, but that's
pretty cumbersome.
