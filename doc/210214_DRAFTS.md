# Drafts for improvement
Since there are many drafts for improvement, I decided to randomly write them
here.

## Entity Query Interface
The entity query interface can provide a better interface for querying (duh),
by building query as an object. This way, we can separate "resolving" engine so
quadtree, b-tree, all sorts of indices can be merged here so basically the
entity store will as a database.

```ts
const store = new EntityStore();

store.query()
  .has(['pos', 'vel', 'mesh'])
  .where('pos', 'WITHIN', [0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1])
  .andWhere('name', 'character')
  .orderBy('RADIUS')
  .execute();
```

....Obviously this is too much. For now, only "has" will be provided, which is
pretty good enough for current purposes.

```ts
const store = new EntityStore();
const query = store.query()
  .has(['pos', 'vel']);

store.on('tick', () => {
  query.forEachGroup((group) => {
    // Whee
  });
});
```

## Standardization of batch processing
Currently, in order to do batch processing, we have to manually step inside
the internals of the data store.

However this would be very, very troublesome to expand. Instead we may expose
accessors that is simple enough to be JIT-ed.

```ts
const store = new EntityStore();
const transform = store.get('transform');
const vel = store.get('vel');

const query = store.query()
  .has(['pos', 'vel']);

store.on('tick', () => {
  query.forEachGroup((group) => {
    group.batch([transform.getBatchPos, vel.getBatch], (pos, vel) => {
      pos[0] += vel[0];
      pos[1] += vel[1];
      pos[2] += vel[2];
    });
  });
});
```

This would further remove the need to access low-level data, however, methods
like `getBatchPos`'s signature need to be rethought.
