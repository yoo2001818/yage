# Renderer
Finally, it's time to build a 3D renderer for the game engine.

It *can* be pretty basic, and we'd rather make a basic renderer first. Well,
the basic renderer should do the following:

- Map LocRotScale to mat4
- Group entities with same geometry, and upload these mat4 to single buffer
- Upload geometry buffer. The geometry is managed as an entity to allow morphing
  and stuff (for now)
- The shader program is also managed as an entity
- The material is also managed as an entity
- The "mesh" component is therefore composed of 2 pointers, a geometry and a
  material
- The renderer collects meshes and issues draw call
- Support for cameras and lights
- The selected camera is specified by the renderer system itself
- Lights are processed in forward-rendering for now

Basically, bare minimum to actually draw something to the screen. Everything
else can be considered later.

We need to come up with some kind of convention for naming uniforms and
attributes too.

- uModel
- uView
- uProjection
- aPosition
- aNormal
- aTexCoord
- aTangent

Should be enough for now.
