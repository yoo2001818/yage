# Strides
Position, velocity, matrix, etc, all uses vector to store its own data.
We could store these vectors in 2D array. But, if we can lay them in 1D array,
it'd be great too.

WebGL resolves this problem using strides - In 1D array, it offsets each
element by 4. When the vector size is 4, each element gets a unique vector. 

The same idea can be used in here too. However, the system code must be aware
of strides, otherwise it'd be reading from wrong place.

Or, given that the systems already know which type each component has - we could
just provide general 2D-array-esque methods for general use and apply strides
whenever the high performance is needed.
