# Scene
The sample needs to support multiple scenes. Each scene needs to have a
mouse-controlled controller - so the user can freely look around the scene.

This means that we have to put "external" object that controls the entity
state. The scene interaction requires attaching keyboard / mouse event onto
the browser, and reacting to it accordingly.

Therefore this is not linked to the engine's state in any way - it should not
be tied to ECS framework. Instead, it should just directly manipulate the
engine's data, and the engine can rerender the scene accordingly, given that
dirty flags are correctly set.
