# Using WebAssembly Instead
While I tried to use JavaScript for everything, It isn't simply feasible to
make everything JIT-worthy and it is extremely cumbersome.

Instead, we can make everything reside inside ArrayBuffer and make its data
layout compatible with WebAssembly. This means that we share same memory layout
with WebAssembly.

This would make everything accessible inside WebAssembly, and JavaScript without
any explicit function call or message passing. Therefore, this enables
multi-threading and various stuff, the engine itself is not dependent on
JavaScript then.
